                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Don't give up just because it's hard. Everyone who is great at something had to go through the growing pains of learning 
                    a new skill. That includes sometimes struggling, not knowing, and doubting. But what makes them great is that they 
                    continued to push through all of that and never gave up when things got hard. You can do that too! I believe in you. I believe in myself.</p>

                <p> You are smart! You are brave! You are so freaking cool for learning something new!</p>
